# Deep Learing

Deep learning has become the most important frontier in both machine learning and autonomous vehicle development. Experts from NVIDIA and Uber ATG will teach me to build deep neural networks and train them with data from the read world and simulator. By the end of this section, I'll be able to train convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs, and to drive a vehicle in the simulator the same way I drive it myself!



## Traffic Sign Classifier

I just finished getting my feet wet with deep learning. Now put my skills to the test by using deep learning to classify different traffic signs! In this project, I will use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs.

#### Required Skills

- [Neural Networks](#neural-networks)

- [TensorFlow](#tensorflow)

- [Deep Neural Networks](#deep-neural-networks)

- [Convolutional Neural Networks](#convolutional-neural-networks)

- [Transfer Learning](#transfer-learning)



###### Neural Networks

Learn to build and train neural networks, starting with the foundations in linear and logistic regression, and culminating in backpropagation and multilayer perceptron networks.



###### TensorFlow

Vincent Vanhoucke, Principal Scientist at Google Brain, introduces you to deep learning and Tensorflow, Googleâ€™s deep learning framework.



###### Deep Neural Networks

How to go from a simple neural network to a deep neural network. I'll learn about why additional layers can help and how to prevent overfitting.



###### Convolutional Neural Networks

Explains the theory behind Convolutional Neural Networks and how they help us dramatically improve performance in image classification.



###### Keras

Take on the neural network framework, Keras. I'll be amazed how few lines of code I'll need to build and train deep neural networks!



## Behavioral Cloning

Put my deep learning skills to the test with this project! Train a deep neural networks to drive a car like me!



###### Transfer Learning

Learn about some of most famous neural network architectures and how I can use them. By the end of this section, I'll know to create new modes by leveraging existing canonical networks.
