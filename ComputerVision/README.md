# Computer Vision
I'll use a combination of cameras, software, and machine learning to find lane lines on difficult roads and to track vehicles. I'll start with calibrating cameras and manipulating images, and end by applying support vector machines and decision trees to extract information from video.



### Finding lane lines on a road 

In this project, I will be writing code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an images, and later in a video stream (redlly just a series of images). 

In this first section, I'll get taste of some basic computer vision techniques to find lane marking on the road. I will be diving much deeper into computer vision in later secion.



### Advanced Lane Finding

In this project, my goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.

Discover more advanced computer vision technique, like distortion correction and gradient thresholding, to improve upon my lane lines algorithm!
