# Control

Ultimately, a self-driving car is still a car, and we need to send steering, throttle, and brake commands to move the car through the world. Uber ATG will walk you through building both proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and model predictive controllers. Between these control algorithms, you’ll become familiar with both basic and advanced techniques for actuating a vehicle.



## PID Controller 

In this project you’ll revisit the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. This time, however, you’ll implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!
