- [Introduction to ROS](#introduction-to-ros)
- [Packages and Catkin Workspaces](#packages-and-catkin-workspaces)
- [Writing ROS Nodes](#writing-ros-nodes)



###### Autonomous Vehicle Architecture

Learn about the system architecture for Carla.



###### Introduction to ROS

Obtain an architectural overview of the Robot Operating System Framework and setup my own ROS environment on my computer.



###### Packages and Catkin Workspaces

Learn about ROS workspace structure, essential command line utilities, and how to manage software packages within a project. Harnessing these will be key to building shippable software using ROS.



###### Writing ROS Nodes

ROS Nodes are a key abstraction that allows a robot system to be built modularly. I'll learn how to write them using Python.
