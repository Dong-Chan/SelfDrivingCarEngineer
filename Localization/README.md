# Localization

Localization is how we determine where our vehicle is in the world. GPS is great, but it's only accurate to within a few meters. We need single-digit centimeter-level accuracy! 



## Kidnapped Vehicle

In this project, I'll build a particle filter and combine it with a real map to localize a vehicle!



#### Required Skills

- [Markov Localization](#markov-localization)
- [Motion Models](#motion-models)
- [Particle Filters](#particle-filters)
- [Implementation of a Particle Filter](#implementation-of-a-particle-filter)



###### Markov Localization

I'll learn the math behind localization as well as how to implement Markov localization in C++.



###### Motion Models

Here I'll learn about vehicle movement and motion models to predict where my car will be at a future time.



###### Particle Filters

Learn it what a particle filter is as well as the theory and math behind the filter.



###### Implementation of a Particle Filter

Now that I understand how a particle filter works, and learn how to code a particle filter.
