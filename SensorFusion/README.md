# Sensor Fusion

Tracking object over time is a major challenge for understanding the environment surrounding a vehicle.

Kalman filters, that how to program fundamental mathematical tools. These filters predict and determine with certainty the location of other vehicle on the road.



## Extended Kalman Filter

In this project, I'll apply everything I've learned so far about Sensor Fusion by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter in C++!

###### Kalman Filters

Through the usage and concepts of a Kalman Filter using Python



###### C++ Checkpoint

Build Kalman Filters with C++



###### Extended Kalman Filters

I'll build a Kalman Filter in C++ that's capable of handling data from multiple sources. Why C++? Its performance enables the application of object tracking with a Kalman Filter in real-time
