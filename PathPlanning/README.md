# Path Planning

Path planning routes a vehicle from one point to another, and it handles how to react when emergencies arise. First, I'll apply model-driven and data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the road will behave. Then I'll construct a finite state machine to decide which of several maneuvers my own vehicle should undertake. Finally, I'll generate a safe and comfortable trajectory to execute that maneuver.



## Highway Driving

Drive a car down a highway with other cars using my own path planners.

- [Prediction](#prediction)
- [Behavior Planning](#behavior-planning)
- [Trajectory Generation](#trajectory-generation)



###### Search

I will learn about discrete path planning and algorithms for solving the path planning problem.



###### Prediction

I'll learn about how to use data from sensor fusion to generate predictions about the likely behavior of moving objects.



###### Behavior Planning

I'll learn about how to think about high level behavior planning in a self-driving car.



###### Trajectory Generation

I'll use C++ and the Eigen linear algebra library to build candidate trajectories for the vehicle to follow.
